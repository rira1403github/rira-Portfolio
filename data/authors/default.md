A software engineer who aims to evolve, innovate, and inspire through technology.

Currently, I am working as a **System Engineer** at **Infosys**.

Previously, I served as a Frontend Development Intern at Lamarr, where I enhanced web interface performance using Next.js 13 and TypeScript, and as a Web Development Intern at scale.jobs, contributing to an AI-powered, real-time job search platform built with the MERN stack. My work emphasized scalability, API integration, and performance optimization.

Beyond my professional experience, I actively engage in the tech community through writing and open-source contributions, including involvement in Indian patent development efforts and contributions to open-source ecosystems. My passion lies in collaborative innovation and building secure, impactful web technologies.
